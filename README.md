# Pushift reddit stream

This is a simple script to collect `author,subreddit` pair from pushift in real
time.

Since pushift no longer shares monthly dumps of data, I decided to collect them
myself, in hopes this should help me build better visualization of related
subreddits (see https://github.com/anvaka/sayit )
